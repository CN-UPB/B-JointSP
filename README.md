# B-JointSP 

**Note: This branch is for ongoing development for another project. It's not thoroughly tested and may be unstable. For the NetSoft'18 submission, please only consider the master branch. This branch only includes the heuristic, not the MIP.**

B-JointSP is an optimization problem focusing on the joint scaling and placement (called embedding) of NFV network services, consisting of interconnected virtual network functions (VNFs). The exceptional about B-JointSP is its consideration of realistic, bidirectional network services, in which flows return to their sources. It even supports stateful VNFs, that need to be traversed by the same flows in both upstream and downstream direction. Furthermore, B-JointSP allows the reuse of VNFs across different network services and supports physical network functions.
