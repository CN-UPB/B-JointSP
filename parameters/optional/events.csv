# sequence of new scenario inputs to model events
# allows arbitrary changes (even multiple at once), e.g., adjusted/new/deleted templates, sources, fixed instances, but not changing the substrate network
# need to add corresponding templates before adding new sources such that the source components can be recognized

# syntax:
# templates: file_paths (separated by white spaces)
# sources: file_path
# fixed: file_path
